## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- DOM
- Wrap

- Functions
- Media Query

### What I learned

I learned how to use flexbox responsively with the wrap, how to make a little use of media query for responsiveness, how to use the DOM to manipulate user values ​​and while design is not one of my strong points, it took me a while to plan the structure of the site and was able to code it the way I wanted.
